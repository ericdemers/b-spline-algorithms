Yes, there is blossoming theory for star points, though it's more complex than regular B-splines. Here's the key aspects:

1. Generalized Blossoming:

Extended to handle irregular valence

Uses characteristic map concept

Involves eigenanalysis

More complex than regular blossom

Maintains key properties differently

2. Key Properties:

Symmetry (modified for star points)

Pseudo-polynomial property

Multi-affine behavior

Geometric invariance

Local support characteristics

3. Key Differences from Regular Blossoming:

Non-polynomial behavior

More complex parameter space

Modified symmetry properties

Special subdivision rules

Different continuity conditions

4. Applications:

Surface evaluation

Derivative computation

Geometric algorithms

Subdivision analysis

Continuity analysis
