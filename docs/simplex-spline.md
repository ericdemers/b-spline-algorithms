Key differences from tensor-product B-splines:

1. Domain Structure :

- Uses barycentric coordinates

- Triangular mesh instead of rectangular grid

- More complex neighborhood relationships

2. Basis Functions :

- Different recursive formula

- Based on barycentric coordinates

- More complex support structure

3. Mesh Navigation :

- Need to find containing triangle

- Compute neighborhoods

- Handle mesh connectivity

4. Evaluation :

- Uses barycentric coordinates

- Different recursion pattern

- More complex support determination
