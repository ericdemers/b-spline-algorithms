Let me explain the T-mesh requirements for analysis-suitable T-splines:

1. Basic T-mesh Rules :

All edges must be either horizontal or vertical

Intersections must form T-junctions or regular crosses

No diagonal connections are allowed

Each face must be a rectangle or L-shaped due to T-junctions

2. T-junction Requirements :

A T-junction occurs when an edge terminates at the middle of another edge

Each T-junction creates an "extension" in the mesh

Extensions must follow perpendicular directions to the terminating edge

No two extensions from different T-junctions can intersect

3. Extension Rules :

For a horizontal T-junction, the extension is vertical

For a vertical T-junction, the extension is horizontal

Extensions must span at least one face

Extensions continue until they reach another edge or boundary

4. Face Topology :

Each face must have four sides

Face corners must be either T-junctions or regular vertices

Faces can be split by T-junction extensions

Face sizes can vary but must maintain rectangular shape

5. Analysis-suitable Conditions :

No intersecting extensions from different T-junctions

Must maintain partition of unity

Must ensure linear independence of basis functions

Local refinement must preserve these properties

6. Refinement Considerations :

When refining a face, check for potential extension intersections

May need to refine additional faces to maintain analysis-suitable properties

Refinement should preserve the T-mesh structure

Must maintain all topological requirements

7. Connectivity Requirements :

Each vertex must connect to at least two edges

T-junctions must connect to three edges

Regular vertices connect to four edges

Mesh must be properly connected with no gaps

8. Boundary Requirements :

Boundary edges must form a closed loop

T-junctions can occur on boundaries

Extensions from boundary T-junctions follow same rules

Boundary must be well-defined

9. Local Structure :

Each vertex has well-defined local neighborhood

T-junction extensions affect local basis functions

Local knot vectors must be properly defined

Local refinement affects neighboring elements

10. Quality Measures :

Face aspect ratios should be reasonable

T-junction placement should be balanced

Extension lengths should be controlled

Overall mesh quality affects analysis

11. Implementation Considerations :

Need efficient data structures for T-mesh representation

Must track T-junction extensions

Need algorithms to verify analysis-suitable conditions

Must handle refinement propagation

12. Common Issues to Avoid :

Intersecting T-junction extensions

Isolated vertices or faces

Improper face topology

Invalid extension patterns

13. Validation Checks :

Verify T-junction extension patterns

Check face topology

Ensure proper connectivity

Validate boundary conditions

14. Maintenance Requirements :

Track T-junction locations

Monitor extension patterns

Update local knot vectors

Maintain mesh consistency

15. These requirements ensure:

Proper geometric representation

Valid basis functions

Good analysis properties

Efficient implementation

Robust refinement

16. Benefits of proper T-mesh structure:

Guaranteed analysis properties

Good geometric representation

Robust refinement options

Clear implementation path

17. The key is maintaining these requirements during:

Initial mesh creation

Local refinement

Global modifications

Geometric updates

18. Understanding and following these requirements is crucial for:

Correct implementation

Valid analysis

Efficient computation

Robust operations

Reliable results
